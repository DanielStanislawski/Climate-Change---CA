            <div class="text">When trees are cut down and burned or allowed to rot, their stored carbon is released into the air as carbon dioxide. And this is how deforestation and forest degradation contribute to Climate Change. According to the best current estimate, deforestation is responsible for about 10 percent of all global warming emissions. <hr> Deforestation is a key contributor to human-caused climate change. When forests are cleared or burnt, they release the carbon they store. Removing trees also diminishes an important carbon “sink” that takes up CO2 from the atmosphere <hr> Deforestation can also affect temperatures through its effect on a range of different physical processes. These effects occur at local and regional scales, but can have global repercussions. <hr>Burning fossil fuels, in combination with destruction of carbon sinks due to deforestation and other activities, has contributed to more and more carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere – more than can be absorbed from existing carbon sinks such as forests. The build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is driving global warming, as it traps heat in the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide levels are now at their highest in human history.<hr></div>

        <p>This map shows the net change in forest cover across the world. Countries with a positive change (shown in green) are regrowing forest faster than they’re losing it. Countries with a negative change (shown in red) are losing more than they’re able to restore</p>

        <p>Deforestation is an important factor related To global warming.With the rate Of increasing deforestation, the impact on Climate grows.The global warming is Caused mainly due to increase in Co2 in the atmosphere.the trees Take in Co2 and gives out Oxygen.Therefore, due to decreasement of trees, The rate of CO2 increases in The atmosphere.This is how, By which the deforestation is related with global warming.</p>

          <h2>Deforestation Causes</h2>
          <div class="column" style="background-color:#9FAFC7;">
            <h2>Forest fires</h2>
            <p>Each year, fires burn millions of hectares of forest worldwide. Fires are a part of nature but degraded forests are particularly vulnerable. These include heavily logged rainforests, forests on peat soils, or where forest fires have been suppressed for years allowing unnatural accumulation of vegetation that makes the fire burn more intensely. The resulting loss has wide-reaching consequences on biodiversity, climate, and the economy.</p>

          <div class="column" style="background-color:#9FAFC7;">
            <h2>Mining</h2>
            <p>The impact of mining on tropical forests is growing due to rising demand and high mineral prices. Mining projects are often accompanied by major infrastructure construction, such as roads, railway lines and power stations</p></div>
              <div class="column" style="background-color:#9FAFC7;">
            <h2>Climate change</h2>
            <p>Forest loss is both a cause and an effect of our changing climate. Climate change can damage forests, for instance by drying out tropical rainforests and increasing fire damage in boreal forests. Inside forests, climate change is already harming biodiversity, a threat that is likely to increase.</p></div>
