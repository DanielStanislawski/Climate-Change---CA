        <div class="text">Climate change in Australia has been  a critical issue since the beginning of  the 21st century. In 2013, the CSIRO <br> released a report stating that Australia is becoming hotter,  and that it will experience more extreme heat and longer fire <br> seasons because  of  climate change. In 2014, the Bureau of Meteorology released a report on the state of Australia's climate <br> that highlighted several key points, including the significant increase in Australia's  temperatures and the increasing frequency of bush fires, <br> droughts and floods, which have all been linked to climate change. Since the beginning of the 20th century Australia has <br> experienced an  increase of nearly 1 °C in average annual temperatures, with warming occurring at twice the rate over the past 50 years than in the previous 50 years.<br> <hr>Recent climate events such as extremely high temperatures and widespread drought have focused government and public attention on the impacts <br> of climate change in Australia. Rainfall in southwestern Australia has decreased by 10–20% since the 1970s, while southeastern Australia <br> has also experienced a moderate decline since the 1990s. Rainfall patterns are expected to be problematic, as rain has become <br> heavier and infrequent, as well as more common in summer rather than in winter, with little <br> or no uptrend in rainfall in the Western Plateau and the Central Lowlands of Australia. <br> Water sources in the southeastern areas of Australia have depleted due to increasing population in urban areas coupled with climate change factors such as persistent prolonged drought .<br> <hr>At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions by Australia continue to be the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions in <br> the OECD. Temperatures in Australia have also risen dramatically since 1910 and nights have become warmer. A carbon tax was <br> introduced in 2011 by the Gillard government in an effort to reduce the impact of climate change and despite some <br> criticism, it successfully reduced Australia's carbon dioxide emissions, with coal generation down 11% since 2008–09. The Garnaut Climate Change Review <br>predicted that a net benefit to Australia may be derived by stabilising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 450 ppm CO2 eq.<br><hr>The carbon emissions in Australia have been rising every year since the Coalition Government abolished the carbon tax. Predictions measuring <br> the effects of global warming on Australia assert that global warming will negatively impact the continent's environment, economy, and communities. <br> Australia is vulnerable to the effects of global warming projected for the next 50 to 100 years because of its <br>extensive arid and semi-arid areas, an already warm climate, high annual rainfall variability, and existing pressures on water supply.<br> Additionally, Australia's population is highly concentrated in coastal areas, and its important tourism industry depends on the health of the Great Barrier Reef and other fragile ecosystems.<br><hr></div></div>

            <p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 80px; margin-top: -220px">As of 14 January 2020, fires this season have burnt <br> an estimated 18. 6 million  hectares , destroyed over 5,900 buildings <br> and killed  at least 34 people. An estimated one  billion <br> animals have been killed and some  endangered species may be <br> driven to extinction.  4 billion of the 2009 Black Saturday <br> fires, and tourism sector revenues have fallen  more than <br> $1 billion.By 7 January 2020, the smoke had moved <br> approximately 11,000 kilometres across the South Pacific Ocean to Chile <br> and Argentina. As of 2 January 2020, NASA estimated that <br> 306 million tonnes of CO2 was emitted. From September 2019 <br>, fires heavily impacted various regions of the state of New <br> South Wales. In eastern and north-eastern Victoria large <br> areas of forest burnt out of control for four weeks <br> before the fires emerged from the forests in late December.</p>
